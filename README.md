## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, location, and other relevant factors. The project utilizes multiple regression techniques to determine the most effective model for this task.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is specific to the Indian housing market. It includes various features such as:

- `SQUARE_FT`: The square footage of the house.
- `LATITUDE AND LONGITITUDE`: The latitude and longitute of the location
- `TARGET(PRICE_IN_LACS)`: The target variable representing the price of the house in lacs.
- Other relevant features that influence house prices.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `course-project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire project code, including data exploration, visualization, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file, which provides an overview of the project.

## Installation
